# Procedure 1: Running PyCoGAPS -- User startup guide for the Python CoGAPS API

We provide two options for running PyCoGAPS (Options A and B). Option A demonstrates running PyCoGAPS as a package in a Python script with an IDE, and Option B demonstrates automatic deployment and running NMF using a Docker image. Both options are functionally equivalent, so the userâ€™s choice of interface should depend on factors such as familiarity with Python and desire for flexibility and modification. Option A provides a full walkthrough of PyCoGAPS package functions. However, to deploy and run PyCoGAPS in fewer steps with limited flexibility, we recommend following Option B. Please refer to Fig. 4 and/or Table 1 to determine which option is most appropriate to follow.
